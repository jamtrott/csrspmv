This is the README file for csrspmv, a program for benchmarking sparse
marix-vector multiplication (SpMV) for matrices in the compressed
sparse row (CSR) format.

Building
--------
The `csrspmv' program can be built with `make'. Compilation and
linking may be configured through the environment variable `CC', which
is used to choose a compiler, and `CFLAGS' and `LDFLAGS', which are
used to set compiler flags and linker flags, respectively. Here is an
example:

     make CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3 -march=native"

Usage
-----
The `csrspmv' program is used to load a matrix from a file in Matrix
Market format (see https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html),
convert it to a compressed sparse row (CSR) representation, and
multiply it with a dense vector. The vector can also be loaded from a
file in the Matrix Market format. Otherwise, a vector of all ones is
used. The vector resulting from the multiplication can also be written
to a file in the Matrix Market format.

Since OpenMP is used for shared-memory parallel computations, the
environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS' can be set to control the
number of threads that are used. In addition, `OMP_PROC_BIND' can be
set to bind threads to particular cores.

If the option `--verbose' is supplied, then some information about the
matrix is printed, as well as the information about the matrix-vector
multiplication, such as the time spent and number of arithmetic
operations performed.

Here is an example of the output:

     ./csrspmv --verbose test.mtx
     matrix_market_read: 0.000128 seconds matrix object coordinate format real field general symmetry 4 rows 5 columns 7 nonzeros
     csr_matrix_int32_from_matrix_market: 0.018245 seconds 4 rows 5 columns 7 nonzeros
     csr_matrix_int32_spmv: 0.000089 seconds 1 multiplications 14 flops

csrspmv is free software. See the file COPYING for copying conditions.

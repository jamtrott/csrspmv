/**
 * `parse_int32()` parses a string to produce a number that may be
 * represented as a 32-bit integer.
 *
 * The number is parsed using `strtoll()`, following the conventions
 * documented in the man page for that function.  In addition, some
 * further error checking is performed to ensure that the number is
 * parsed correctly.  The parsed number is stored in `number`.
 *
 * `valid_delimiters` is either `NULL`, in which case it is ignored,
 * or, it may contain a string of characters that constitute valid
 * delimiters for the parsed string.  That is, after parsing a number,
 * if there are any remaining, unconsumed characters in the string,
 * `parse_int32()` checks if the next character is found in the string
 * `valid_delimiters`.  If the character is not found, then the string
 * is judged to be invalid, and `EINVAL` is returned.  Otherwise, the
 * final, delimiter character is consumed by the parser.
 *
 * If `endptr` is not `NULL`, the address stored in `endptr` points to
 * the first character beyond the characters that were consumed during
 * parsing.
 *
 * On success, `parse_int32()` returns `0`.  Otherwise, if the input
 * contained invalid characters, `parse_int32()` returns `EINVAL`.  If
 * the resulting number cannot be represented as a signed 32-bit
 * integer, `parse_int32()` returns `ERANGE`.
